# event-ai
Hi! In this project, we create customized timeline checklist for your event using the
target event date and predictions from other event timelines from the internet. 

This project is made using python on the backend for webscrapping to make these
predictions and to create Tensor Flow models to create custom timelines for each 
new event. The front end is made more reactive with Node.js, HTML, Tailwind.CSS,
and Next.js.
